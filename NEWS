Significant changes to the RNifti package are laid out below for each release.

===============================================================================

VERSION 0.2.1

- Examples have been added to the R-level documentation.
- Image pixel dimensions are now used to return a more sensible xform matrix in
  the case where the NIfTI-1 sform and qform are both marked unknown.

===============================================================================

VERSION 0.2.0

- The writeNifti() function now performs path expansion on its argument,
  matching the behaviour of readNifti(). (Reported by John Muschelli.)
- Calling as.array() on an internal image containing no data now returns an
  array full of NAs (with a warning), rather than crashing R. (Reported by Tim
  Tierney.)
- The package should now work correctly with sparse MriImage objects, from
  first-party package "tractor.base".
- Images with invalid internal pointers are now handled (with a warning) by
  attempting to reconstruct the missing data structure. This should not happen
  in regular use, but can occur when external pointers are handed back to the
  main thread by worker threads when working in parallel. (Reported by Takeo
  Katsuki.)
- Calling the RNifti API from within OpenMP threads could previously lead to a
  stack imbalance. This is now guarded against, and a new C function,
  niftilib_register_all(), has been added as the recommended way to preregister
  all NIfTI-1 library functions wrapped by RNifti, particularly in threaded
  applications.
- Doxygen comments have been added to the C++ code to document the low-level
  API. A Doxyfile has also been added to the package root directory.

===============================================================================

VERSION 0.1.0

- First public release.
